<h1>The History of Coffee</h1>
<h2>No one knows exactly when or where coffee originated, but there are plenty of legends of when it came about. Coffee can trace its heritage back many centuries to the Ethiopian Plateau. Legends there say that someone who herds goats named Kaldi was the first to discover the future upcoming of these tiny beans. It is said that Kaldi discovered these beans after eating berries from a tree, his goats got so restless and did not go to sleep that night. Kaldi told the abbot of the local monastery and he made a drink with the berries and discovered that it kept him awake during the long evening prayers. The abbot then told other monks at the monastery about the beans and the acknowledgment of the beans that kept them awake. The word spread eat and eventually coffee ended up in the Arabian peninsula and it began its journey to spread across the world.</h2>
